Project Summary
Project Title:
Outcome-Based Student Assessment and Analytics System

Summary:
The project aims to develop a comprehensive web-based system for universities to evaluate and analyze students achievement of course learning outcomes (LOs). The system allows instructors to link assessment items (such as exam questions or assignments) to specific learning outcomes, enter student grades, and automatically calculate performance per outcome. Advanced analytics and reporting modules provide actionable statistics at the course, program, faculty, and university levels, enabling data-driven improvement and supporting accreditation processes.

Key Features
Map assessment items/questions to learning outcomes.

Assign and distribute marks across multiple LOs.

Record and aggregate students marks for each LO.

Validate mark distribution and LO coverage, preventing conflicts.

Multi-level statistics: by student, course, program, faculty, university.

Visual dashboards for achievement tracking and decision-making.

Role-based access for instructors, admins, and students.

2. Enhancements to Make It World-Class and Competitive
To make the system “rival” and best-in-class, consider these enhancements:

Accreditation Readiness: Built-in alignment with major accreditation standards (e.g., ABET, AACSB, NCAAA).

AI-Powered Insights: Predict student risk, recommend interventions, and benchmark LO achievements using machine learning.

Bulk Import/Export: Seamless Excel/CSV import and export for grades, questions, and mappings.

Rubrics Support: Advanced rubrics for subjective assessments and holistic grading.

Feedback Loops: Automated feedback for students per LO, based on their performance.

Continuous Improvement: Tools for curriculum mapping, gap analysis, and closing-the-loop tracking.

Multi-language/Localization: Arabic/English interface for wider adoption.

API Integrations: Easy connection with SIS, LMS, or other institutional systems.

Mobile-Friendly UI: Responsive Angular design for instructors and students on any device.

Notifications: Smart reminders for grading, reporting, and follow-ups.

Audit Trails: Complete change and access logs for transparency and compliance.

## **1. Solution Structure**

Use a **modular monolith** approach for extensibility. Suggested main modules:

* **Core Domain Module** (Entities/Aggregates, Domain Services, Domain Events)
* **Application Module** (DTOs, Application Services, Query Services)
* **Web API Module** (Controllers, API endpoints)
* **Angular UI** (Feature modules for each business domain)

---

## **2. Key Domains and Aggregates**

### **A. Students**

* Aggregate Root: `Student`
* Properties: `Id, Name, StudentNumber, Email, ...`
* Relationships: Enrollments, Responses

### **B. Courses**

* Aggregate Root: `Course`
* Properties: `Id, Code, Name, Credits, DepartmentId, ...`
* Relationships: LearningOutcomes, Assessments, Enrollments

### **C. Learning Outcomes (LO)**

* Aggregate Root: `LearningOutcome`
* Properties: `Id, Description, MaxMark, CourseId, ...`

### **D. Assessment**

* Aggregate Root: `Assessment`
* Properties: `Id, Title, Type, CourseId, Date, ...`
* Relationships: Questions

### **E. Question**

* Aggregate Root: `Question`
* Properties: `Id, Text, AssessmentId, MaxMark`
* Many-to-Many: `QuestionLearningOutcome` (which LOs this question assesses)

### **F. Enrollment**

* Aggregate Root: `Enrollment`
* Properties: `Id, StudentId, CourseId, Status, ...`
* Used for student-course registration

### **G. StudentResponse**

* Aggregate Root: `StudentResponse`
* Properties: `Id, StudentId, QuestionId, Grade, Comment`

---

## **3. Implementation Steps & Principles**

### **A. Define Domain Entities & Aggregates**

* **Use ABP’s Entity base class** (audited, tenant-aware if needed)
* Define navigation properties for relationships (EF Core)
* Use value objects where appropriate (e.g., `Grade`)
* Raise domain events on key actions (optional for extensibility)

### **B. Repositories**

* One repository per Aggregate Root (ABP best practice).
* E.g., `IStudentRepository`, `ICourseRepository`, `ILearningOutcomeRepository`, etc.

### **C. Domain Services (if needed)**

* Encapsulate business logic that spans aggregates, e.g., grade validation, LO aggregation.

---

## **4. Application Layer**

### **A. DTOs**

* **Create DTOs for all CRUD operations** (Create, Update, Read, Delete)

  * Example: `CreateLearningOutcomeDto`, `UpdateLearningOutcomeDto`, `LearningOutcomeDto`
* Use `AutoMapper` for entity <-> DTO mapping.

### **B. Application Services**

* **One service per major entity/aggregate**

  * `StudentAppService`
  * `CourseAppService`
  * `LearningOutcomeAppService`
  * `AssessmentAppService`
  * `QuestionAppService`
  * `EnrollmentAppService`
  * `StudentResponseAppService`
* **Methods** for each business requirement (add, update, delete, map, import, etc.)
* **Inject repositories and domain services**
* **Validation** (use Data Annotations or FluentValidation as needed)

### **C. Use CQRS Pattern for Queries**

* Separate read models if you need complex/statistical queries.

---

## **5. Web API Layer**

* **RESTful controllers** for each AppService (ABP auto-generates if using Application Service pattern)
* **Custom endpoints** for reporting/statistics, as needed (e.g., `GetOutcomeStatistics`, `ExportGrades`)

---

## **6. Angular Frontend**

* **Use ABP Angular template**
* **Feature modules:** Students, Courses, LOs, Assessments, Grading, Reports
* **Component per use case:** LO mapping, assessment/question management, grade entry, analytics dashboard
* **Services:** Use ABP-generated proxies for backend communication
